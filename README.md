**Nusantara AI Project** is an offline-ready, privacy-first artificial intelligence initiative powered by the **Google Gemma 3** large language model. This project is built for researchers, developers, and hobbyists who want to explore large language models (LLMs) on their local machine — without any cloud dependencies.

It runs entirely offline using [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com), a fast and developer-friendly LLM runtime. With minimal configuration, you can start experimenting with advanced AI models like Gemma 3 directly on your laptop or desktop — even with modest hardware.

## 🌟 Project Vision

The **Nusantara AI Project** was born out of a desire to:

- Empower individuals and communities in Indonesia (and beyond) with access to cutting-edge AI technologies.
- Promote digital independence by running models locally, with full data control and zero reliance on proprietary cloud services.
- Foster education, innovation, and responsible AI usage in Southeast Asia through open-source tools.
